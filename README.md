Console-based game of Blackjack/Twenty-One.

## Summary
Blackjack (also known as Twenty-One) is a casino game where the player must beat the dealer by having a count as close to 21, without going over 21. 
One to eight standard 52-card decks are used, as well as a special card that is not played, but indicates to the dealer when a re-shuffle is pending.
Players start with two cards face-down while the dealer has one face-down and one face-up. 

Aces have a value of 1 or 11 (player's choice), face cards are worth 10, and all other cards are worth its pip number.
During each turn, a player can "stand" which passes the drawing phase, or choose to "hit" (draw cards) as many times as possible in succession, 
eventually standing or busting (going over 21).

On the dealer's play, they must hit while their count is 16 or under, and must stand if their count is 17 or more.

Starting with a 10-card and an ace is called a natural or a blackjack, and it is an auto-win unless the dealer has blackjack in which case the game is a draw.
